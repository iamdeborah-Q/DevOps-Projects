## DEVOPS TOOLING WEBSITE SOLUTION

This project builds on the 3-tier architecture we saw earlier by adding a Network file System(NFS) to our system architecture(website). The NFS host the static files needed to server our site to the public while the database stores the dynamic data. This architecture makes our webserver stateless: meaning we can easily configure and scale our webserver up or down as need arises.
