## LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH NGINX AND SSL/TLS

In this project we will be implementing load balancing using Nginx. Nginx is a powerful software able to handle many concurrent connections. We will also be implementing SSL/TLS. Which secures the site from Man in the Middle Attack.

## Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer
* Create an EC2 VM based on Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS and name it Nginx LB (do not forget to open TCP port 80 for HTTP connections, also open TCP port 443 – this port is used for secured HTTPS connections)
- Update /etc/hosts file for local DNS with Web Servers’ names (e.g. Web1 and Web2) and their local IP addresses
* Install and configure Nginx as a load balancer to point traffic to the resolvable DNS names of the webservers
- Update the instance and Install Nginx
        
               sudo apt install nginx
        
- Open the default nginx configuration file and paste the text below:
              
              sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
              
        
    
      #insert following configuration into http section

         upstream myproject {
            server Web1 weight=5;
            server Web2 weight=5;

          }

        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name www.domain.com;
            location / {
              proxy_pass http://myproject;
            }
          }
          
          #comment out this line
          #include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
