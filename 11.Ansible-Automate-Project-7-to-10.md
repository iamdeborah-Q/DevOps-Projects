In this project, the Jenkins server from project 9 Web Architecture is setup and configured to function as a Jump Server/Bastion Host by using Ansible Configuration Management which helps to automate most of repetitive tasks done in previous projects.

Install ansible on our jenkins server and rename it to Jenkins-Ansible

            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install ansible
            ansible --version

Create a new repository called ansible-config-mgt on github and set up webhooks on it.



                        https://<jenkins_url:port/github-webhooks>
                        

On the Jenkins server, create a job called ansible and configure automatic builds when a trigger is made on the ansible-config-mgt directory via GITScm polling.
